							<b>CAMBYZE Terms of Service</b>
						</p>
						<p>Thank you for using CAMBYZE! We're happy you're here.
							Please read this Terms of Service agreement carefully before
							accessing or using CAMBYZE. Because it is such an important
							contract between us and our users, we have tried to make it as
							clear as possible.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>An "Account" represents your legal relationship with
								CAMBYZE. A “User Account” represents an individual User’s
								authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a
								User’s identity on the CAMBYZE web site located on the CAMBYZE
								server in European Union countries. “Organizations” are shared
								workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with
								one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across
								many projects at once. A User Account can be a member of any
								number of Organizations.</li>
							<li>“CAMBYZE,” “We,” and “Us” refer to CAMBYZE as well as
								our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors,
								officers, agents, and employees.</li>
							<li>The “Service” refers to the applications, software,
								products, and services provided by CAMBYZE</li>
							<li>“The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual
								person, company, or organization that has visited or is using
								the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the
								Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the
								performance of its functions.</li>
							<li>The “Website” refers to CAMBYZE website located at
								cambyze.com, and all content, services, and products provided by
								CAMBYZE at or through the Website. It also refers to
								CAMBYZE-owned subdomains of cambyze.com.</li>
							<li>You must provide a valid email address in order to
								complete the signup process. Any other information requested,
								such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting
								these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need
								more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a
								paid Account, in which case additional information will be
								necessary for billing purposes.</li>
							<li>You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts
								registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not
								permitted. We do not permit machine accounts</li>
							<li>You must be age 16 or older. While we are thrilled to
								see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program,
								we must comply with European Union law. CAMBYZE EURL does not
								target our Service to children under 16, and we do not permit
								any Users under 16 on our Service. If we learn of any User under
								the age of 16, we will terminate that User’s Account
								immediately. If you are a resident of the European Union or of a
								country outside the European Union, you are responsible for
								complying with your country’s laws.</li>
							<li>Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a
								single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid
								Organization may only provide access to as many User Accounts as
								your subscription allows.</li>
							<li>Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any
								applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export
								control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction.
								You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service
								is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.</li>
							<li>You may create or upload User-Generated Content while
								using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content
								of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content
								that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via
								the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not
								responsible for any public display or misuse of your
								User-Generated Content. We do not pre-screen User-Generated
								Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to
								refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole
								discretion, violates any CAMBYZE terms or policies. You retain
								ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're
								posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the
								rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content
								you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the
								right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third
								party licenses relating to Content you post. This license does
								grant CAMBYZE the right to sell Your Content or otherwise
								distribute or use it outside of our provision of the Service.</li>
							<li>CAMBYZE EURL and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or
								our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual
								property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service.
								We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you
								under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website
								and Service is copyright © CAMBYZE. All rights reserved. You may
								not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS,
								Javascript, Java, SQL or visual design elements or concepts
								without express written permission from CAMBYZE.</li>
							<li>Abuse or excessively frequent requests to CAMBYZE via
								the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of
								your Account's access to the API. CAMBYZE, in our sole
								discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API.
								We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to
								suspension. You may not share API tokens to exceed CAMBYZE rate
								limitations. You may not use the API to download data or Content
								from CAMBYZE for spamming purposes, including for the purposes
								of selling CAMBYZE users' personal information, such as to
								recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.</li>
							<li>It is your responsibility to properly cancel your
								Account with CAMBYZE. You can cancel your Account at any time by
								sending an email to CAMBYZE. You may use the "Contact us"
								hyperlink in the footer of the CAMBYZE Website to send us
								emails.</li>
							<li>CAMBYZE has the right to suspend or terminate your
								access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or
								without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately.
								CAMBYZE reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any
								reason at any time.</li>
							<li>For contractual purposes, you consent to receive
								communications from us in an electronic form via the email
								address you have submitted or via the Service; and agree that
								all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and
								other communications that we provide to you electronically
								satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would
								satisfy if they were on paper.</li>
							<li>Communications made through email or CAMBYZE Support's
								messaging system will not constitute legal notice to CAMBYZE or
								any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any
								situation where notice to CAMBYZE is required by contract or any
								law or regulation. Legal notice to CAMBYZE must be in writing
								and served on CAMBYZE's legal agent.</li>
							<li>CAMBYZE offers support via email, in-Service
								communications, and electronic messages. We do not offer
								telephone support.</li>
							<li>CAMBYZE provides the Website and the Service “as is” and
								“as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting
								this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express,
								implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service
								including without limitation any warranty of merchantability,
								fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and

								meet your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted,
								timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided
								through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any
								defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be
								available at any particular time or location; or that the
								Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. You
								assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from your
								downloading and/or use of files, information, content or other
								material obtained from the Service.</li>
							<li>We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from
								your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising
								under this agreement. We will have no liability for any failure
								or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control.</li>
							<li>You are responsible for your use of the service. If you
								harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we
								will not be involved.</li>
							<li>"Changes to These Terms" - We reserve the right, at our
								sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and
								will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such
								amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this
								Agreement, such as price changes, at least 30 days prior to the
								change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website. For
								non-material modifications, your continued use of the Website
								constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of
								Service. You can view all changes to these Terms in our Site
								Policy repository. We reserve the right at any time and from
								time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or
								permanently, the Website (or any part of it) with or without
								notice.</li>
							<li>This Agreement between you and CAMBYZE and any access to
								or use of the Website or the Service are governed by the
								European Union laws, without regard to conflict of law
								provisions. You and CAMBYZE agree to submit to the exclusive
								jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in the city of
								Paris, France.</li>
							<li>CAMBYZE may assign or delegate these Terms of Service,
								in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or
								without your consent. You may not assign or delegate any rights
								or obligations under the Terms of Service without our prior
								written consent, and any unauthorized assignment and delegation
								by you is void.</li>
							<li>This Agreement may only be modified by a written
								amendment signed by an authorized representative of CAMBYZE, or
								by the posting by CAMBYZE of a revised version in accordance
								with the above section "Changes to These Terms". These Terms of
								Service, together with the GitHub Privacy Statement, represent
								the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between
								you and us. This Agreement supersedes any proposal or prior
								agreement oral or written, and any other communications between
								you and GitHub relating to the subject matter of these terms
								including any confidentiality or nondisclosure agreements.</li>
